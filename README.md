# wows-mod-loader

Make duowan Wargaming mods working with Wargaming's own clients and load your favorite Wargaming mods in a more elegant way. 

Tested on World of Warships, supports world of tanks / aircrafts theoretically.

## Usage

1. Put this program in the root game folder
2. Create sub folders for your mods and put these folders under ``res_custom`` folder
3. Run the program! (It would auto-detect Duowan mods and convert)

For CLI options, please discover by yourselves, I am just too tired today for writing a manual for it. It would be up soon.
