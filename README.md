# MUSASHI

**This project, previously named "wows-mod-loader", is being REWORKED!**

> Part of my code might still look gross as it was but I am working on it! CSharp-based GUI is also on the schedule. 

Make duowan Wargaming mods working with Wargaming's own clients and load your favorite Wargaming mods in a more elegant way. 

Tested on World of Warships but might also work on World of Tanks / Aircrafts (Since they were all made by WARGAMING).

## Usage

1. Put this program in your game's root folder
2. Create sub-folders for your mods and place these folders under ``res_custom`` folder (It would handle Duowan stuff automatically)
3. Run the program. It would take usually less than a minute to finish (Depending on how much mods are there and how fast your HDD/SSD is)
